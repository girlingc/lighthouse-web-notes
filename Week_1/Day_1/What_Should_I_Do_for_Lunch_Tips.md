### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators ('<', '>', '===', etc.) inf the node REPL, which you can launch using the 'node' command in vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use 'hungry' and 'avaliableTime' inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("avaliableTime is", avaliableTime);
}
```
